# Data Findings (Flight Dataset)

### By Amar Singh


## INSTALLATION:
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*

## PROJECT MOTIVATION:


In this project flight data set were chosen for the data exploration and explanatory purpose. It include every steps that are follwed by the data analys from gathering the data from site to asssesing then cleaning the data to make it tidy for easy exploaration and then fron the exploratory vizualization the explanatory vizualization were done.

The Data set contains about 22,719 entries for the year 2019, there were more than 100' s of question that can be asked from this data set but i have included only 4 main questions from the data which i feel would be everyone's else question:
 - One is "Which Airlines is mostly used in the season 2019 by the traveler?"
 - Second " Which Month was the busiest month i.e more airlines were flied?"
 - Third "Month having the highest average of arriving delay of flight by 15 minutes"
 - Last but not the least "Main Reason for the Delays in flight"

## GATHERING DATA:

 - gathering data from site: http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html
 - imported using pandas functions
 
## Cleaning Data:
 - Several quality and tidiness issues which were their in the datasets were dealed properly.


## Exploration and Explanatory Analysis:

Various Plots were used to analyse the data sets and based on the exploratory analysis explanatory anallysis were then made


## SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS:


 - SkyWest Airlines Inc. were the most popular airlines used by the people for travelling.
 - SIXth month i.e **JUNE** were reported to be the month having highest No. of arriving delays.
 - the arrival delay and the other 3 delay causes were found to have positive correlation between them and after visualizing the Bivariate graph it is seen thaat late aircraft delay cause was having the highest correlation when compared to other two. 

# Insights:

 - The two Main reeason for the fligth delay were the **carrier Delay** and **Late Airport Delay**
 - The Starting month of the season i.e **JANUARY** was found to be the bussiest month for the airlines as more people travelled in it while the second bussiest month was the end of the year.
**NOte: reason could be the Christmas and New year**
